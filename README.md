<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Repository
India's massive work force is being hit hard by coronavirus. As many as 21 million salaried jobs have been lost between April and August, according to a recent report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Hospitality, aviation, media, entertainment and automobile parts manufacturers are among the sectors seeing the most job cuts.

In September 2020, India saw an unemployment rate of over six percent. This was a significant improvement from the previous months. A damaging impact on an economy as large as India‚Äôs caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to 24 percent on May 17, 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies. Furthermore, this caused a GVA loss of more than nine percent for the Indian economy that month.

So, I created a repository to analyse the unemployment in India

### Built With

To perform this task we have pre-defined libraries, by using them we can easily achieve our task.
* [Pandas](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp)
* [PlotlyExpress](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
* [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
* [Calender](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-calendar-module/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Any python Compiler

### Installation

1. Install packages
   ```sh
   pip install pandas
   pip install plotlyexpress
   pip install calender
   pip install datetime
   ```



<!-- OBJECTIVE EXAMPLES -->
## Objective

To know the covid-19 impact on job market

which state survive and which state has more impact on

This dataset contains the unemployment rate of all the states in India

States = states in India

Date = date which the unemployment rate observed

Frequency = measuring frequency (Monthly)

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%) = percentage of people unemployed in

each States of India

Estimated Employ



ed = Number of people employed

Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%) = The labour force participation rate is the portion of the working population in the 16-64 years' age group in the economy currently in employment or seeking employment.



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Let's see an [Example](https://github.com/aniketyadav20/Unemployment-in-India/blob/main/unemployment.ipynb)

</p>
In this above video, we can see that it is the plot between 'Estimated Uneployment Rate' and 'States', and easily identify the outliers.
There are lots of graph in my code to identify the insights in the dataset. 





You can develop your own model and improve accuracy by using others algorithms and tuning Hyperparameteres. Good Luck üòé
